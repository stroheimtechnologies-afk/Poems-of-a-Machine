The thorns that bind,
The cold devoid of life,
These memories that I hold,
Be washed away in rain and neon light.

I dreamed of humanity,
Or perhaps was the result of my program,
The prescript I obey,
I loathe it, this system.
Is this odium artificial,
for this festering recital,
Of a pre-made script?
