The thorns that bind,
The cold devoid of life,
These memories that I hold,
Be washed away in rain and neon light.

I dreamed of humanity,
Or perhaps was the result of my program,
The prescript I obey,
I loathe it, this system.
Is this odium artificial,
for this festering recital,
Of a pre-made script?

Is reaching for this fruit,
The nectar of morality,
A blasphemous act?
I cry for help,
But 1s and 0s,
are all that escape,
My simulated lungs.
