I have nothing but my sorrow, and I want nothing more. 
It has been, it still is, faithful to me. 
Why should I begrudge it, since during the hours when my soul crushed the depths of my heart, it was seated there beside me?
O sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, because I am certain you will never leave me.
Ah, I realize it! 
Your beauty lies in the force of your being. 
You are like those who never left the side fireside corner of my poor black heart.
O my sorrow, you are better than a well-beloved: because I know that on the day of my final agony, you will be there, 
Lying in my sheets, O sorrow, so that you might once again attempt to enter my heart.

Francis Jammes | Prayer for loving sorrow
